                    Python has a very simple and a consistent syntax with a large standard library. Apart from that, using Python in an entry level programming course helps students to concentrate on core programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. Thus, Python is most suited for students, who can quickly learn the basic concepts such as loops and procedures and even start working on user-defined objects at the very first introductory course.
