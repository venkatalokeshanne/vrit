                    SAP S/4HANA Finance, which was previously called SAP Simple Finance, is the first business application developed for the S/4HANA finance platform. It is designed to remove traditional barriers between transactional, analytics, and planning systems to provide instant insights and on-the-fly analysis using all levels of financial data. A business decision maker, for example, can use SAP S/4HANA Finance to model data and create forecasts of potential decisions using real-time financial data from various systems.
