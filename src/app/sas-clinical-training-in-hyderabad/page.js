                    SAS is widely used in clinical trial data analysis in pharmaceutical, biotech and clinical research companies. SAS programmers play an important role in clinical trial data analysis. In addition to doctors and clinicians who collect clinical trial data, the group conducting data analysis includes statisticians, clinical data managers (COMs) and SAS programmers. Statisticians provide the ideas and methods of the data analysis, clinical data managers manage the collected data and control the data quality.
