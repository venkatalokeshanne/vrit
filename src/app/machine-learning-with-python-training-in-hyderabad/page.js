                    In a very layman manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data do we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate.

                    In the older days, people used to perform Machine Learning tasks by manually coding all the algorithms and mathematical and statistical formula. This made the process time consuming, tedious and inefficient. But in the modern days, it is become very much easy and efficient compared to the olden days by various python libraries, frameworks, and modules. Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for this task and it has replaced many languages in the industry, one of the reason is its vast collection of libraries. Python libraries that used in Machine Learning are:

                    Data science is prominent from the other two fields because its agenda is to gain insight and understanding. It is descriptive , exploratory and causal, not everything that produces insights qualifies as data science. Traditionally data science involves a combination of statistics, software engineering, and domain expertise.

                    Data scientists might use simple tools on SQL queries. They could also use very complex methods. They might work with distributed data stores to illustrates of records, developing most advanced statistical techniques, and build interactive with set of information as a chart or other image. Whatever they use, the hope strongly to achieve to gain a better understanding of their data.
