                    Data scientists can use a variety of AI tools to generate meaningful insights. Though Data Science is an interdisciplinary field encompassing various domains, the beauty of the course is that it does not require any formal degree to get into this area of knowledge. The skills in subjects like mathematics, statistics/operations research, business or many others can be leveraged with strong foundation in basic mathematics and computer programming. Accordingly, data scientists may apply quantitative techniques to get into deeper aspects of mining for generating insights, i.e. inferential models, segmentation analysis, time series forecasting, synthetic control experiments and more. Hence the data-driven insights are quite crucial in offering strategic direction, wherein data scientists act as consultants, offering the right direction to various business stakeholders on how to act on such inferences for effective decision making.
