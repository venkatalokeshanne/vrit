      question: "What is Hadoop and why is it important for Big Data processing?",
      answer: "Hadoop is an open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters. It's important because it enables cost-effective processing of massive amounts of structured and unstructured data that traditional databases cannot handle efficiently."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the prerequisites for Hadoop training?",
      answer: "Basic knowledge of Java programming, understanding of Linux/Unix commands, familiarity with SQL databases, and basic networking concepts. Having analytical thinking and problem-solving skills is beneficial. We provide foundational support for beginners."
    },
    {
      question: "What components of Hadoop ecosystem will I learn?",
      answer: "You'll learn HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), MapReduce, YARN, Hive, Pig, HBase, Sqoop, Flume, Oozie, Spark, Kafka, and other ecosystem tools. We cover both Hadoop 2.x and 3.x versions with hands-on practice."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the duration of the Hadoop training course?",
      answer: "Our comprehensive Hadoop training is designed to be completed in 50-60 hours, which can be taken as weekend batches (8-10 weeks) or weekday batches (6-8 weeks) depending on your schedule and learning pace."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I work on real Big Data projects during training?",
      answer: "Yes! You'll work on multiple hands-on projects including data ingestion using Sqoop/Flume, data processing with MapReduce/Spark, data warehousing with Hive, and real-time processing projects using industry datasets from various domains."
    },
    {
      question: "What career opportunities are available after Hadoop training?",
      answer: "Hadoop professionals can work as Big Data Developer, Hadoop Developer, Data Engineer, Big Data Analyst, Hadoop Administrator, Data Architect, ETL Developer, or Big Data Consultant with salaries ranging from ₹4-15 LPA depending on experience."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Hadoop compare to traditional databases and cloud solutions?",
      answer: "Hadoop excels in processing large volumes of unstructured data cost-effectively, offers horizontal scalability, and handles batch processing efficiently. While cloud solutions offer managed services, Hadoop provides flexibility and control over big data infrastructure."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you cover both on-premise and cloud-based Hadoop deployments?",
      answer: "Yes, our training covers on-premise Hadoop clusters, cloud distributions like Amazon EMR, Google Cloud Dataproc, Azure HDInsight, and hybrid deployments. You'll learn deployment strategies for different environments."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide placement assistance and job support?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer 100% placement assistance including portfolio development, resume building, interview preparation with big data case studies, mock interviews, and connecting you with our network of companies hiring Hadoop professionals."
    },
    {
      question: "What ongoing support do you provide after course completion?",
      answer: "We provide lifetime support including doubt resolution, career guidance, job support for big data projects, access to updated course materials, latest Hadoop updates, industry trends, and alumni network for continuous learning."

                    With Hadoop, you can run applications with thousands of commodity hardware nodes and to manage thousands of terabytes of data. It is an open source software framework that is used for distributed storage and processing of datasets of big data. This is done using the MapReduce programming model. It offers a distributed file system that helps in swift data transfer rates among nodes and lets the system to continue operating, even if there is a node failure. This approach minimizes the risk of catastrophic system failure and data loss, though a sizeable number of nodes remain inoperative. It can be firmly stated that Hadoop can be called as the primary foundation for processing big data tasks – sales planning & business, scientific analytics and processing huge volumes of sensor data.

                        In traditional databases, you need to preprocess the data before storing it. However, in Hadoop, this functionality is done away, which means there is no limitation to the data storage and helps you decide how to use it later. This even includes unstructured data like text, images and videos.
