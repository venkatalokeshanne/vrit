### 2. Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file contains the Sanity configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

### 3. Navigation Links

```

## Customization

### Styling

The blog uses Tailwind CSS classes. You can customize the appearance by modifying the classes in:
- `/src/app/blog/page.js` - Blog listing page
- `/src/app/blog/[slug]/page.js` - Individual blog post page
- `/src/app/admin/page.js` - Admin panel

### Content Types

The blog uses the following Sanity schema types from your sanity project:
- `post` - Blog posts
- `author` - Author information
- `category` - Post categories
- `blockContent` - Rich text content
- `seo` - SEO metadata

### Rich Content

For more advanced content editing (images, code blocks, callouts), you can:
1. Use the Sanity Studio directly for rich content editing
2. The blog pages support the portable text renderer for rich content

## Security Notes

**Important**: The current admin authentication is for demonstration only. In production, you should:

1. Implement proper authentication (NextAuth.js, Auth0, etc.)
2. Use secure password hashing
3. Add role-based access control
4. Use HTTPS in production
5. Consider API rate limiting

## File Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── layout.js          # Admin authentication layout
│   │   └── page.js            # Admin panel interface

## SEO Features

The blog includes comprehensive SEO optimization:

6. **Add Features**: Consider adding comments, search, or newsletter signup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error fetching data"**: Check your Sanity configuration and API token
2. **No posts showing**: Ensure you have published posts in Sanity
3. **Images not loading**: Verify your Sanity project ID and image URLs
4. **Admin panel not working**: Check the password and ensure client-side code is working

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify your Sanity schema matches the expected structure
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test the Sanity API connection independently
